Explanation of Updates
1. Resolution and Scaling

    // Screen Dimensions: Changed to 1920x1080.
    Virtual Resolution: Defined as 640x480 for game logic.
    Scaling Factor: 2.25 (1080/480), applied to all sizes and positions.
    Offset: 240 pixels horizontally to center the 1440x1080 game area.

2. Game Elements

    Player: Still 32x32px in virtual space, rendered as 72x72px (32 * 2.25).
    Bullets: 8x16px virtual, 18x36px actual.
    Enemies: 32x32px virtual, 72x72px actual.
    Power-Ups: 16x16px virtual, 36x36px actual.
    Positions are scaled and offset: actual_x = virtual_x * 2.25 + 240, actual_y = virtual_y * 2.25.

3. Background Scrolling

    Texture Size: Remains 640x960px (virtual), scaled to 1440x2160px for rendering.
    Scrolling Logic: Operates in virtual coordinates (bgY increments by 100px/s). When bgY >= 480, it wraps back, and two source rectangles are rendered:
        Bottom part: From bgY to 480, scaled to fit the game area.
        Top part: From 0 to remaining height, positioned below the bottom part.
    Destination Rectangles: Fixed at {240, 0, 1440, 1080} with adjusted heights to match source content.

4. Rendering

    All SDL_Rect destinations are computed with scaled sizes and offset positions.
    Black bars appear naturally as the game area doesn’t fill the full 1920px width.

5. Audio and UI

    Sound: Added SDL2_mixer for shooting and explosion sounds, unchanged by resolution.
    Score: Rendered at (OFFSET_X + 10, 10) for visibility in the game area.

Prerequisites

//    Libraries: Install SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf.
        Linux: sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
        Windows/Mac: Use a package manager or download from SDL’s site.
    Compilation: g++ -o game game.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2_ttf
    Assets:
        player.png (32x32px)
        bullet.png (8x16px)
        enemy.png (32x32px)
        powerup.png (16x16px)
        background.png (640x960px)
        shoot.wav, explosion.wav (sound effects)
        arial.ttf (font file)

Notes

  //  Assets: The original low-res sprites may appear pixelated when scaled. Consider higher-res versions (e.g., 72x72px player) for better visuals.
    Aspect Ratio: Black bars maintain the 4:3 ratio. For full-screen, you could stretch to 1920x1080, but it would distort the game.
    Testing: Ensure the background scrolls smoothly; adjust bgY increment if needed.

This code should run at 1920x1080 with all elements scaled appropriately. Let me know if you need further refinements!
