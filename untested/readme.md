# Grok Code

Where:
- 0 = empty space
- 1 = solid block
- 2 = ladder

To compile this code, you'll need SDL2 installed and link it appropriately. On Linux, you might compile with:
```
gcc -o game game.c -lSDL2
```

This implementation includes:
1. Basic player movement (walking, jumping, crouching, climbing)
2. Map loading from a text file
3. Simple collision detection
4. Gravity and physics
5. Ladder climbing
6. 32x32 pixel blocks and player size

Missing features that you might want to add:
1. Sprite animations (currently uses colored rectangles)
2. Shooting mechanics
3. Enemy AI
4. Better collision detection
5. Sound effects
6. Health system
7. Multiple levels

To add these features, you would need to:
1. Load and manage sprite sheets for animations
2. Implement a projectile system
3. Add enemy movement patterns and AI
4. Improve collision detection with more points
5. Include SDL_mixer for sound
6. Add damage and health management
7. Create a level loading system

Would you like me to expand on any of these aspects or help with implementing any of the missing features?
