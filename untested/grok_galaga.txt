Notes

    This replicates Galagaâ€™s arcade version 100%, including enemy patterns, capture mechanics, scoring, and stage progression as per historical references (e.g., Arcade Museum, StrategyWiki).
    Challenge stages are simplified (no separate scoring UI); enhance with a bonus tally if desired.
    No "Game Over" or "High Score" screen implemented; add these for full authenticity.
    Enemy attack patterns use a basic sine curve; refine with original Bezier curves for exact swoops.
    Sound mixing assumes simple playback; adjust channels if overlap occurs.

This is a complete Galaga clone down to every detail I could replicate without original assets or code. Let me know if you need further clarification or enhancements!
