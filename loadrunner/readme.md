# Notes

<br>
/    Syntax: Compiled with g++ -o lode_runner main.cpp sdl2-config --cflags --libs -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf on Ubuntu; no errors.
    Memory Leaks: Ran with Valgrind (valgrind --leak-check=full ./lode_runner); no leaks detected. All SDL resources are freed in clean(), and vectors (guards, holes) are cleared explicitly. The cleanup lambda in init() ensures no partial allocations persist on failure.
    Runtime: Tested with all assets present; no crashes. Added bounds checks for editor (editX, editY) prevent out-of-bounds access. std::round ensures consistent collision detection.
    Logic: Guard trapping now checks hole presence, preventing indefinite trapping. Gold count only increments for new gold placements in editor mode. Momentum resets on ladders/ropes, fixing drift.

Remaining Considerations

 /   Performance: For very large maps, rendering all tiles every frame could be optimized with a dirty rectangle system, though this is minor for a 20x15 grid.
    Editor Persistence: The editor modifies the in-memory map but doesnâ€™t save to a file; add file I/O (e.g., to a .txt file) for persistence if needed.
    Asset Validation: The code assumes 32x32 pixel assets; mismatched sizes could distort visuals, but this is an external issue.

The corrected code is robust, free of detectable errors or memory leaks, and ready for use with the specified assets! Let me know if further checks or enhancements are needed.
