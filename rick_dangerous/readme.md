# Notes

  /  Health System: Player starts with 3 health, losing 1 per enemy/trap hit. Dies when health reaches 0.
    Traps: Currently simple; expand with specific trap types (e.g., spikes, falling ceilings) by adding more logic to the Trap struct.
    Level Design: The level is basic; enhance it with platforms, secrets, and more traps as needed.
    Performance: Scrolling is optimized by rendering only visible tiles, but large levels may need further optimization.

This extended code brings the project closer to a full Rick Dangerous remake, with room to add more mechanics like shooting, bombs, and detailed level design.
